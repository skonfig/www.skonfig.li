<h1>Hello</h1>

<p>
	skonfig is a system configuration and automation
	framework designed to work with all systems, from your
	toaster to the data centre. All you need is an SSH
	connection and a POSIX/UNIX-like shell environment.
</p>
<p>
	And best of all: you already know how to use it
	(if you know shell scripts).
