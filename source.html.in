<h1>Getting the source&hellip;</h1>

<p>
	The source code of skonfig is hosted on
	<a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and uses three
	main repositories:
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="https://github.com/skonfig/skonfig.git" target="_blank">skonfig</a>
			- implementation of the skonfig executable,
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://github.com/skonfig/base.git" target="_blank">base</a>
			- explorer and types for general use,
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://github.com/skonfig/extra.git" target="_blank">extra</a>
			- special purpose types and incubator for new types.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>What are <i>base</i> and <i>extra</i>?</h2>

<p>
	<b>base</b> explorers and types are used to change the state of the
	operating system or core components of it and are not for some specific
	piece of software. Furthermore, the quality requirements for inclusion in
	base are higher than for extra.
</p>
<p>
	<b>extra</b> contains types for specific purposes like configuring software
	or services which don't belong to the operating system and also serves as an
	incubator for new types.
</p>
<p>
	Even more types can be found in sets specialised in helping you configure a
	specific piece of software. Some of these sets can be found on
	<a href="https://github.com/skonfig/" target="_blank">https://github.com/skonfig/</a>.
</p>
<p>
	And being a fork of <a href="https://cdi.st/" target="_blank">cdist</a>
	originally, your cdist manifests and types will continue to work with
	skonfig with no or minimal adjustments.
